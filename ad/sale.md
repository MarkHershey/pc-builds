# One-year-old PC for Sale

![](00.jpg)

I am selling my one-year-old custom-built PC. The PC is in excellent condition and has been well taken care of.

Key features:

-   Intel i7-12700K (12 Cores, 5.0 GHz)
-   RTX 3090 (24 GB VRAM)
-   32GB Memory (3600 MHz)
-   2TB NVMe SSD

What's NOT included:

-   No monitor, keyboard, or any peripherals included.
-   No Windows license included. (Currently running Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS, I can help you install Windows if you want.)

About warranty:

This is a custom-built PC by myself. The parts for this PC were purchased from Amazon US, Amazon SG, and Amazon JP. The parts are covered by the manufacturer's warranty. I can provide most (not all) of the components' receipts and the original packaging if needed.

## Price

-   Original cost: S$3,500+ (components cost only)
-   **Now Selling at: S$1,500**

(The 3090 alone should be worth this price. It is a good deal.)

## Detailed Specifications

Perfect for gaming, and deep learning. Extremely quite and cool.
